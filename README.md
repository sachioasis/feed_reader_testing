# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. We will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

# How to Run 

Just open index.html with a browser to see the page and run the test at the same time.

# Existing Technologies Used
- Jasmine
- jQuery
